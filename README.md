# Numpy_practice_1

This repository contains examples and practice exercises for getting started with NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

## What is NumPy?

NumPy is a Python library used for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, along with tools for working with these arrays. NumPy is the fundamental package for numerical computing with Python.
